# 🌍 Personal Website

## Description

Introducing  ——>  **[https://aadriien.github.io](https://aadriien.github.io)**  <——  my personal portfolio site! 

This is where I showcase my work as a **Software Engineer**, highlight projects I've developed, and incorporate fun personal touches. My goal in building this website was to develop a vibe that is informative and playful, as much as it is professional. 

Enjoy visiting my small piece of the internet!


## Pages and Features

- **About Me**: Who I am, who I'm connected with (affiliations + webring), and how to reach me

- **Tech**: What kind of work I'm doing, and what tech I'm learning

- **Projects**: A collection of things I've built—whether for purpose or play 

- **Places**: A cool way to check out my travel recommendations via an interactive globe


## Design Choices

### A focus on interaction
From filtering collections, to expanding cards, to generating images on hover, to spinning a hyper-realistic Three.js globe, to clicking geolocated ripples, this site is meant to be explored.

### Togglable color scheme
YOU choose the background! Zesty stripes or classic solids, in a variety of colors. All are based on my avatar's color palette to tie the theme together.

### A retro introduction
My `about me` section is delivered on the screen of a retro computer terminal, with real-time typing (plus human-realistic pauses), a blinking cursor, and of course, a bright green text that's reminiscent of the old school PC.

### Starry creativity
This same retro computer terminal also has a sparkling, star-strewn nebula in the background—at a reduced opacity to maintain text visibility.

### Sleek and balanced
A consistent, relaxed structure maintains cohesion and organization throughout the site. Thoughtfully-crafted features add a touch of whimsy and playfulness, with pops of color to brighten the theme. 


## Acknowledgements

When first starting to build this site, I began by iterating on [codewithsadee's](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) open source profile template. I have since made extensive modifications—adjusting layout, style, functionality, etc., and adding several features specific to my needs. However, much of the core skeleton (e.g. navbars, grids, etc.) reflects Sadee's work. Thank you, Sadee!
